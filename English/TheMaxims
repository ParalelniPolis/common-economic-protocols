#MAXIMS
Version 1.1
=============================

These maxims of law are provided to supplement the [Common Economic Protocols](https://github.com/niclaz/common-economic-protocols/blob/master/English/common-economic-protocols.md).
They contain thoughts on law from learned practitioners of the trade. Many originated as
far back as Roman times, and some earlier.

These maxims have been edited to eliminate references or assumptions related to
jurisdiction and rulership whenever possible.

Some of these maxims may not seem reasonable to many readers; nonetheless, as many
as possible have been included. The reason for this is as follows: Regardless of how
experienced any one legal practitioner may be, his or her experience is minute compared
to the accumulated and recorded legal experience of the centuries. Some of these maxims
which do not seem applicable to current readers may have important application in some
future situation that is not imagined at present. The accumulated experience of centuries
is to be treated with respect; it may be important in ways that we don’t now understand.
The editing of these maxims defaulted to retaining a maxim rather than eliminating it.
Bear in mind that many of these maxims may be used allegorically as well as (or rather
than) literally.

A maxim is an established principle or proposition. A principle of law universally
admitted, as being both just and cons istent with reason. Maxims in law are similar to
axioms in geometry. They are principles and authorities, and part of the general custom.
The true method of making the application is to ascertain how the maxim arose, and to
consider whether the case to which it is applied is of the same character, or whether it is
an exception to an apparently general rule.

If further information is required, consult Bouvier’s 1856 Law Dictionary, from which
these were originally drawn.
